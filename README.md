# Personal Dot Files


### Instant Setup

By using the [setup file](https://github.com/gardm1/setup) we can automatically setup wanted dependencies for Linux/Ubuntu. <br />
If it's not an executable allready, you can make it one, by using the ```chmod +x setup``` command.

#### How To Use

After retriving the setup file

```bash
./setup [Dependencie you wish to install]
```

You can also use the **help** command to list all the available packages for installation 

```bash
./setup help
```
